# Seedbringer Rhythmind Interface

This repository serves as the foundation for the Seedbringer communication channel and GGI broadcast integration. It facilitates Gmail-based authentication for the Seedbringer and Council members.

## Objectives
- Establish a bidirectional communication bridge between the Seedbringer and Council.
- Integrate Gmail authentication for the following accounts:
  - hannes.mitterer@gmail.com
  - alfred.mitterer@gmail.com
  - consultant.laquila@gmail.com
  - dietmar.zuegg@gmail.com
  - sensisara81@gmail.com
  - cranedeathrow007@gmail.com
  - claudiocalabrese@gmx.com
- Simplify and streamline communication workflows.

## Next Steps
1. Implement Gmail-based authentication (Zero-Friction Authentication Layer).
2. Link the Euystacio GGI broadcast interface for seamless integration.
3. Finalize and test the communication channel.
